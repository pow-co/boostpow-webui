<h2 id="donald-trump">Donald Trump</h2>
<p>Famous TV-star Donald Trump gave the POWCO Rewards Token his highest endorsement[^1]: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re going to be very happy when you see what the POWCO Rewards Token can do. Very, very happy. Everybody agrees. Initially I said I couldn&#39;t believe it. It&#39;s absolutely the best--but losers wouldn&#39;t understand. Sad!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[^1] <em>(Donald Trump has not yet actually endorsed or acknowledged the POWCO Rewards Token.)</em></p>
<p>The Power to Know Instantly With Absolute Measurable Certainty To Eight Decimal Places What Matters Most to the Users of BitCoin.</p>
<p>POWCO Holders are Part of an Elite Global Cabal That Secretly and Anonymously Steer the Direction of the BitCoin System Toward Good ...or Evil!</p>
<p>Your tokens can be used to vote on the direction. </p>
<h2 id="satoshi-nakamoto">Satoshi Nakamoto</h2>
<p>Dr. Craig Steven Wright, Undisputed Inventor and Patent Holder of the First IBM Computer[^2], said this about POWCO: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s absolutely illegal, and I hate it. Buy it only if you want to go directly to jail immediately and become someone&#39;s bitch, because that is exactly what will happen the instant POWCO appears in your Relay wallet. There is no hope for you. Stiff! Full Stop!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[^2] <em>(Dr. Craig Wright is a brilliant scientist and this is all in good fun, please don&#39;t sue us Craig, please, we&#39;ll do anything. PS We love your red socks, really, it&#39;s not tacky at all.)</em></p>
<h2 id="powco-gives-you-powers">POWCO Gives You Powers</h2>
<p>Once you hold POWCO in your wallet, you will want to do something with it right away. You have endless options at your fingertips.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First, if you are a developer, you are going to want to immediately integrate POWCO into your BitCoin app. You want to give POWCO holders special hidden features and benefits for insiders only. It&#39;s fun and cool and so are you, so that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, if you are a gamer, you are going to want to check to see if your POWCO unlocks any hidden levels, premium items, special side-quests, or adult-themed FMVs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Third, if you are an NFT collector, you are going to want to offer your premium POWCO tokens up for sale at 1000% above markup. You bought them early, which makes them more rare and adds value[^3]. Speculate and show off your shiny rare token for cool people only.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[^3] <em>(No, it doesn&#39;t. Maybe. We don&#39;t actually know.)</em></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Fourth, and truly, you will be able to use the website Pow.co like a really special person. Buttons and links will appear to you as a POWCO holder that you would not see otherwise. You will for example see connections between the most trending content, the most valuable tags for boosting, the history of a tag&#39;s popularity over time, and the freshest most secret memes on the internet.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-is-proof-of-work-anyway">What is Proof Of Work Anyway?</h2>
<p>You know when you see some super muscular dude like Duke Nukem and you think, <em>&quot;Man, that guy is cool!&quot;</em> Behind the scenes there is Proof Of Work doing its magic on your brain. Subconsciously, you know that his huge muscles and Devil-may-care attitude stem from a very real place of confidence -- an abundance of real competance that says, <em>&quot;F**k your mother! Stop staring at my biceps already, and come blow me!&quot;</em></p>
<h3 id="thats-proof-of-work">That&#39;s Proof of Work.</h3>
<p>The muscles. The attitude. The energy that radiates from a person or thing when you just take one look at it and instantly know: <em>THAT&#39;S IT!!!</em> </p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more to it than that, but you get the point. Wasting energy and taking risks. It&#39;s what life is all about.</p>
<p>And now the digital world <em>(where, let&#39;s be real, you spend 99% of your time)</em> has its equivalent of big dirty muscles. Or antlers. Or huge tits. Or whatever you want to picture.</p>
<p>It&#39;s about <strong>signaling what matters</strong>. What&#39;s important. One glance, and boom, you know instantly. You scroll Twetch, and it&#39;s a nightmare. A hodge-podge of posts from strangers of varying value, mostly duds. F**k that.</p>
<h2 id="get-the-good-stuff-now">Get the good stuff now.</h2>
<p>Our team of scientists and engineer are studying your brain waves as you read this and importing your thoughts directly into our goupy secret formula for the next rewards token. </p>
<p>We already know that as you are reading this, you have already decided to buy one POWCO just to take it for a spin, and that you want to see what hidden features it unlocks for you. </p>
<p>But just you wait. You are going to be amazed and buy even more next month, and as BitCoin grows in value and popularity, you will see that the POWCO in your wallet does more than you ever imagined. And the biggest benefits come to those who hold it early.</p>
<h2 id="sven-kramer">Sven Kramer</h2>
<p>Speed skating legend Sven Kramer said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;I&#39;ll take as many tokens as I can get. That b*tch Tonya Harding wouldn&#39;t own a single POWCO. I will own thousands.&quot;</em>[^4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[^4] <em>(We don&#39;t know if Sven Kramer ever said this, but we don&#39;t know that he</em> didn&#39;t <em>say it, either.)</em> </p>
<p>It will probably give you super-powers. </p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p><em>None of the statements on this site constitutes an actual contract. POWCO tokens have no monetary value. There is no guarantee that POWCO will get you any benefits now or in the future, and we at team POWCO do not promise to deliver you anything in exchange for these mysterious tokens. We are simply having as much fun as we possibly can within the limits of human and machine capacity. We really love fun, and we sincerely believe you will be pleasantly surprised by the things that come your way by virtue of the fact that you hold POWCO tokens. But just to be safe, this offering is not available to persons or corporations based in the United States, the Republic of North Korea, Cuba, Afghanistan, Iran, or any of the bad places where only bad people live. If you own any POWCO tokens, you have acquired them fraudulently and Craig Wright is going to turn them into digital lead as soon as he finds out! Stiff!</em> </p>
<p>Just get one and see what happens, and if you like it, get some more. They are easy enough to buy and sell on the Relay marketplace. You have nothing to lose![^5] </p>
<p>[^5] <em>You could lose everything. Please do not spend any money you cannot afford to lose.</em></p>
<p>But really, we think it&#39;s a good thing. We have them.  </p>
<h2 id="geena-davis">Geena Davis</h2>
<p>We will leave you with a final word from our biggest supporter and Jeff Goldblum&#39;s one-time spouse, film and television&#39;s Geena Davis: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;I don&#39;t know what POWCO is, and that&#39;s why you should own some.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[^6] This never happened.</p>
